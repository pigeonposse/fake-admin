== Description ==


🕵️‍♀️🔌 Wordpress plugin that prevents your admin user from being exposed to the public.

### Protect Your WordPress Admin User with FakeAdmin

Have you ever published a post or page on _WordPress_ from your admin account without realizing that you are exposing your admin user to the public? 🙈 It is a common mistake as well as frustrating, especially if your blog is personal and you are the **administrator** and blog writer.

Do not care anymore! 🤗 With **FakeAdmin** you can prevent your admin user from being publicly exposed.

### How does it work?

The plugin allows you to create a _"ghost"_ user that looks like your admin user, but without the ability to create or edit anything. Once the **FakeAdmin** user is created, as an administrator, you can work on your _WordPress_ site without worrying about exposing your admin user to the public. Everything you create or edit will be attributed to the user **FakeAdmin** and the security of your site will not be compromised.

It's a simple and effective solution! Now you can work on your site with peace of mind knowing that you are protecting you.
