Do not care anymore! ðŸ¤— With FakeAdmin you can prevent your admin user from being publicly exposed.`,

Once the *FakeAdmin* user is created, as an administrator, you can work on your WordPress site without worrying about exposing your admin user to the public. Everything you create or edit will be attributed to the user FakeAdmin and the security of your site will not be compromised.

It's a simple and effective solution! Now you can work on your site with peace of mind knowing that you are protecting you.`,
